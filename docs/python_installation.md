## Windows

Install a recent `Python (>=3.8)` distribution. Popular ones that are free and open-source are **Anaconda** or  **WinPython**. Both have the editor `Spyder` and `notebook` functionalities. 

If you use a work laptop from KU Leuven, the proper way to install **Anaconda** is given here: https://it-support.set.kuleuven.be/support/solutions/articles/7000044361-avoid-blocking-of-anaconda-by-applocker

*outdated* the applications may not be whitelisted so make sure to install them under `C:\Program Files\` as administrator. Afterwards make sure to change the writing rights of the installation folder so that user accounts can install new packages.


## Ubuntu 

Python is preinstalled normally. If you don't have an editor yet, you can choose `spyder`:

    sudo apt-get install spyder
